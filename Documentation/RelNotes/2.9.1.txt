Magit v2.9.1 Release Notes (unreleased)
=======================================

Changes since v2.9.0
--------------------

* The `:use-prefix' argument of `magit-define-popup' can now also be
  a function, which makes it possible to show the popup or invoke the
  default action directly based on context.  #2894

* The function `magit-display-buffer' now sets the focus on the frame
  used to display the selected window.  #2865

Fixes since v2.9.0
------------------

* When creating a commit, `magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1'
  filled the entire frame, hiding the commit message buffer.  #2891

* `magit-reflog' and `magit-reflog-current' reported a revision's
  reflog as empty when the name of a file in the repository, relative
  to the top-level directory, matched the revision name.  5264ffcb

This release also contains documentation updates, typo fixes, and
fixes for minor bugs.
